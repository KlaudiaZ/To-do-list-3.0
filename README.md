# To-do App v3.0

An object-oriented version of the app.

- Bootstrap 4 (Bootswatch)
- TypeScript
- PHP (for API)

The current version of the app does not support token authorization.

To run the application locally:
- install XAMPP/WAMPP/MAMPP (or any other Apache server)
- download 'dist' and 'server' folders, place in a server-supported directory
- in /server/config/Database.php change username and password to match your local DB
- run index.html


Known bugs:
- editing and removing task doesn't work in online version on GH Pages (and I'm still looking into the reason why this is happening)
